## Project Overview

**Kitten Kingdom** is a personal front-end web project I built to explore layout design, branding, and storytelling through code. It's a fictional website for a cat rescue and adoption service, designed to feel cozy, inviting, and full of heart.

This project gave me a chance to combine creative direction with technical fundamentals like HTML and CSS. While some parts are fully functional, others are more conceptual and meant to show how a real site might behave.

## Pages Included

Each page has its own role in the experience. Some forms are just visual designs with no submission functionality, while others are interactive.

### `index.html`  
The homepage welcomes visitors with a short message, two buttons to conceptual forms (newsletter signup and adoption inquiry), and links to the rest of the site. These buttons are for show and do not actually submit anything (yet?).

### `outcats.html`  
A cat gallery page featuring all available shelter cats. The layout was designed with filters in mind (age, breed, temperament), but these are static and not connected to any back-end (yet!).

### `emergencyshelter.html`  
This page includes two forms: one for requesting emergency shelter and another for starting the adoption process. Like the homepage forms, these are conceptual and meant to demonstrate layout only.

### `oursuccess.html`  
A celebration of fictional success stories for the cats of Kitten Kingdom. Each adopted cat is introduced with a photo and example text.

### `contactus.html`  
This is the only page with a working form. Users can write a message to the shelter, which gets submitted and redirects to the confirmation page.

### `confirmation.html`  
Displays the user‚Äôs submitted message and confirms successful delivery. This page only works when arriving from the contact form.

## Project Goals

- Build a fully responsive, multi-page site using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap  
- Use color, tone, and layout to create a friendly and trustworthy feel  
- Mix functional and conceptual forms to demonstrate different design approaches  
- Show how front-end development can tell a story and build emotional connection  

---

## Future Improvements

If I revisit this project, I‚Äôd love to:

- Add JavaScript for real form handling and interactive filtering  
- Improve mobile responsiveness with Flexbox or CSS Grid  
- Make the forms smarter with validation and animations  
- Build out a full adoption workflow or volunteer portal
