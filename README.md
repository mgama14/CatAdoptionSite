Kitten Kingdom is a fictional cat adoption and rescue service. Logo drawn by me. 

I have built a website concept for this service, with 5 pages: 

🐾 The index page, where a hypothetical adoptee can be briefly introduced to the cats hosted by the shelter and get an idea of Kitten Kingdom's mission statement. The adoptee can subscribe to a hypothetical newsletter and adopt on this page.

🐾 The "Our cats" page. This displays all cats currently residing at the shelter, with conceptual filters based on age, breed, and temperment. 

🐾 The "Emergency Stays" page. A hypothetical adoptee can submit an adoption request form, as well as a temporary stay request form for emergencies. 

🐾 The "Our Stories" page, which would display the services success stories with cats that they have rescued.

🐾 The "Contact Us" page, which is a way for a hypothetical adoptee to reach out to the shelter. The form here is operational, and when used will bring the user to a confirmation feedback page, referred to as "confirmation.html" in the files.

The goal of this project was to create a warm, welcoming, and practical site for my fictional service.
